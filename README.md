# InflationDb

InflationDb allows you to take a dollar amount from any year between 1635 and 2018 and find that amount adjusted for inflation in 2019.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'inflation_db'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install inflation_db

## Usage

Call on the calculation method by adding this line to your code:

```calculate_inflation(year_of_original_amount, that_original_amount)```

and the method will return a float rounded to two decimal places.

## Roadmap

Future releases will include the ability to calculate inflation from any year (post-1635) to any later year (not just 2019); and the ability to reverse the calculation, ie calculate what a 2019 dollar amount would have been worth in a previous year.
